## About Project

it is a stroke prediction application that is working on the basis of client data .and gives you the output, and we are taking the data for training the model from Kaggle and its a data of private hospital basically it is in the raw form so firstly we have to convert the data into a proper format so then we can fit our data into the prediction model.

## Model with their Accuracy of Prediction

| Disease        | Type of Model            | Accuracy |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Brain Stroke   | Machine Learning Model   | 88.65%   |

## NOTE

==> You can access the website live at: [abhipatel.online](https://www.abhipatel.online/) <br>
==> Python version 3.6.8 was used for the whole project.<br>
==> You can find all the models in [models](https://github.com/abhipatel31-7/STROKE-PREDICTION-ABHI) folder.
